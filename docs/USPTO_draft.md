# Provisional Patent Draft — Quantum Bioenergetics Atlas

**Title:** Systems and Methods for Quantum Bioenergetic Diagnostics Using Omics-Parameterized Open-Quantum Simulations

**Claims (sketch):**
1. A method comprising: receiving an omics profile; mapping said profile to quantum transport parameters (ε, J, γ); simulating an open quantum system with dephasing and sink/loss channels; computing Energy Transfer Efficiency (ETE), coherence lifetime (τc), and a composite vitality score; outputting a disease-relevant biomarker.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein mapping includes non-linear transforms and pathway-specific weighting, generating a Metabolic Coherence Map with edge sensitivities.
3. A system comprising: (i) a quantum life engine implementing the method, (ii) a cohort analysis module comparing groups, and (iii) a visualization dashboard for clinical and research use.
